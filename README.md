## About

Xaloc is an in-development 2D game engine written in C++, allowing an ECS approach and C# scripting.

I develop it in my spare time as a personal project, so expect frequent periods of time with no activity in this repository.

</p>

## Set up

You can clone Xaloc using git. Make sure you do a ```--recursive``` clone!

```git clone --recursive https://github.com/pacojq/Xaloc```

Xaloc Engine is built in a Windows environment, using Visual Studio 2019. 

Execute the script `scripts/Win-GenProjects.bat` 
to generate the solution and project files.

### .NET Framework 

In order to build Xaloc, you will need to have the .NET Framework SDK installed. The engine's C# scripting module
targets .NET Framework 4.7.2.


## Compiling and Executing

The default startup project is the `Sandbox` App.

Remember to build the **entire solution** if you modify the C# files in `SandboxCs`, since the `.dll` file for the
scripting project is generated appart from the main Sandbox application.

## Current Features

Right now, Xaloc is very bare-bones. Its most remarkable features are:

| Feature | Description | Status |
| ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| **Scene system** | Scene-based entity management. Scene serialization with XML. | Done✔️ |
| **ECS support** | Entity Component System approach through *entt*. Sort list of components, including `TransformComponent`, `SpriteRenderer`, `TagComponent` and `BehaviourComponent`. | Done✔️ |
| **C# scripting** | Basic scripting in C# using mono. | Done✔️ |
| **2D Renderer** | 2D batch renderer supporting OpenGL. | Done✔️ |
| **ImGui support** | Basic game editor and in-game debug UI using ImGui. | Done✔️ |
| **Asset manager** | Basic asset handling API. | Done✔️ |

 

## Planned Features

| Feature | Description | Status |
| ------- | ----------- | ------ |
| **Better asset manager** | Packaging assets, streaming, etc. | WIP 💻 |
| **Audio system** | Sound API. | TODO 📋 |
| **Physics system** | Own 2D physics API. | TODO 📋 |
| **Font support** | Extend the Renderer capabilities so it can draw text. | TODO 📋 |


The game editor is in continuous development.
